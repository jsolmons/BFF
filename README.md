Binary Function Fuzzer (BFF)

This is a beta program for fuzzing functions within binary programs. The goal is to perform dynamic vulnerability testing in select functions of an individual program, rather than testing the entire software package. This strives to make vulnerability testing more efficient.

In it's current phase the function under test must only contain a single string as an argument. In the future, this should be expanded to other types: integers, structures, and pointers.
